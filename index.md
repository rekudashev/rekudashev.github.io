Hello, and welcome to my website!

I'm a doctoral student at the University of Luxembourg under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Picard.

I am a structural urban economist who employs quantitative spatial urban models to investigate the economic impacts of cross-border labor mobility and taxation on housing markets, labor market outcomes, and the well-being of individuals.

This fall, I will join VU Amsterdam as a postdoctoral researcher.

Feel free to explore the site, and if youâ€™d like to know more about my work, you can also check out my [CV](/assets/files/CV_2025.pdf).
