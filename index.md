Hello, and welcome to my website!

My name is Raian, and I'm a doctoral student at the University of Luxembourg.

I am a structural urban economist who uses quantitative spatial urban models and applies them to cross-border labor mobility, taxation, and housing markets.

Feel free to explore the site, and if youâ€™d like to know more about my work, you can also check out my [CV](/assets/files/CV.pdf).
