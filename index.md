Hello, and welcome to my website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Spatial Economics at VU Amsterdam. 

My research focuses on structural urban economics, using quantitative spatial urban models to study the economic impacts of cross-border labor mobility and taxation on housing markets, labor market outcomes, and individual well-being.

Feel free to explore the site, and if youâ€™d like to know more about my work, you can also check out my [CV](/assets/files/CV_2025.pdf).
