### **Work in Progress**

  <p>
    Cross-border housing markets have become more prevalent in Europe since the establishment of the European Union. With data from the functional urban area of Luxembourg, we document significant floorspace rent discontinuities at the borders of Luxembourg with Belgium, France, and Germany. Using a quantitative spatial urban model and spatial regression discontinuity techniques, we show that differences in tax rates account for up to 16\% of the floorspace rent discontinuity. The remaining rent discontinuity is explained by differences in land use, productivity, and amenities. Equalizing tax regimes would lower Luxembourg rents by 160 euros per month for an average apartment, with additional reductions of 383 euros when combined with equalized land use restrictions.

#### **Welfare Effects of Congestion in Luxembourg and the Greater Region**

    This paper addresses the issue of cross-border traffic congestion in Luxembourg, where more than half of the labor force is made up of international workers. Although the removal of congestion is generally considered positive for production, our study employs a quantitative spatial urban model to uncover and quantify the potential negative consequences for residents. We find that residents of the Greater Region are willing to pay up to 650 euros per month for congestion-free commutes. The willingness to pay of Luxembourg City residents is significantly lower than average.

#### **Trading Miles for Rents: A Radiation Model of Cross-Border Commuting and Residential Location**

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>
   This paper develops a spatial general equilibrium model to analyze commuting and migration decisions in a cross-border setting where labor and housing markets are marked by large price differentials. We build on a modified radiation model, allowing for heterogeneity in (i) job attributes (wages and commuting times) across multiple occupations and sectors and (ii) individuals’ characteristics (age, gender, and education). Our model also embeds congestion externalities and endogenous housing prices. Calibrating to unique pixel-level data from the Greater Region around Luxembourg, we document three core findings. First, incorporating job heterogeneity alters the elasticities of commuting with respect to wages and travel times, relative to standard gravity approaches. Second, reducing commuting costs (e.g., via improved infrastructure or access to telework) raises aggregate welfare but heightens geographic inequalities: cross-border commuters flock to high-wage locales, bidding up local rents and inflating housing costs. Third, expanding housing supply, particularly in high-demand areas, dampens upward pressure on rents and mitigates congestion but does so unevenly across the region. Overall, our analysis illuminates how cross-border labor mobility interacts with both commuting externalities and localized housing constraints, highlighting policy trade-offs for balanced regional development.
